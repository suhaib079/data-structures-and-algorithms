# Hashtables
Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

# Challenge
The challenge was with collisions and implementing a linked list to solve them, also with testing internals.

# Approach & Efficiency
The approach used is to convert the key of the input into index and put the key value object in the hashtable, that contains a linked list for the collisions.

# Big O Notation
Time: O(N)
Space: O(1)

# API

Insert key, value pair in the hashtable.
Hash keys to determine is which index it should be added.
Make a link_list to handle collisions.
Retrieve the value of the bucket using its key.
Determine if a specific key is inside the hashtable or not.
