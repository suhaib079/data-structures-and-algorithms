# graphs
A graph is a  data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes  and a set of edges connecting them. A pair (x,y) is referred to as an edge, which communicates that the x vertex connects to the y vertex. 

# Challenge
implement a working graph using python and create an adjacent list and useing dictionary

# Approach & Efficiency
used dictionary for better time complexity

 Space : O(n) 
 Time : O(n)

# API
Adds a node.
Adds an edge.
Gets all the nodes.
Gets the neighbors of an input node.
Gets the size of the graph.
