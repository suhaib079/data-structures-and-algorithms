# Trees
collection of nodes  that each node is a data structure consisting of a value

## Challenge
create a tree  that create nodes  with left and right childs , then a binary search tree that can add new values

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n) 

## API
pre_order:  (Root->Left->Right)
in_order: (Left->Root->Right)
post_order:(Left->Right->Root)
